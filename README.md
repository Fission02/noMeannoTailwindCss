# Project Title: ShieldHerSpace

## Overview
ShieldHerSpace is a project dedicated to addressing the critical issue of sexual assault victims.
With a deep commitment to making a positive impact, I've integrated features such as an HTML table session and JavaScript functionalities to offer essential support.

In addition to addressing the challenges faced by sexual assault victims, ShieldHerSpace goes beyond by incorporating features tailored for mentally disturbed individuals.
It also includes support from law enforcement (Police) and integrates educational videos for awareness.
