# Project Title: ShieldHerSpace

## Overview
ShieldHerSpace is a project dedicated to addressing the critical issue of sexual assault victims.
With a deep commitment to making a positive impact, I've integrated features such as an HTML table session and JavaScript functionalities to offer essential support.

In addition to addressing the challenges faced by sexual assault victims, ShieldHerSpace goes beyond by incorporating features tailored for mentally disturbed individuals.
It also includes support from law enforcement (Police) and integrates educational videos for awareness.

# Tailwind CSS Setup for Visual Studio Code

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Tailwind CSS in your project using Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create a New Project

Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code.

### 2. Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### 3. Initialize a New Node.js Project

Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and run:

bash
npm init -y


### 4. Install Tailwind CSS and Dependencies

Run the following command in the terminal:

bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer


### 5. Create Tailwind CSS Configuration

Generate a `tailwind.config.js` file:

bash
npx tailwindcss init -p


### 6. Create PostCSS Configuration

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in your project's root directory:

js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};


### 7. Create a CSS File for Your Styles

Create a new CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) and import Tailwind CSS:

css
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';

/* Your custom styles go here */


### 8. Build Your CSS

Add a script to your `package.json`:

json
"scripts": {
  "build:css": "postcss styles.css -o output.css"
}


Run the script:

bash
npm run build:css


### 9. Install Tailwind CSS IntelliSense Extension

Open the Extensions view in Visual Studio Code (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense". Install the extension for better autocompletion and IntelliSense support.

### 10. Link the CSS File in Your HTML

Link the generated CSS file (e.g., `output.css`) in your HTML file.

## Usage

Now, you have successfully set up Tailwind CSS in your Visual Studio Code project. Start using Tailwind CSS classes in your HTML files, and the IntelliSense extension will provide suggestions as you type.
